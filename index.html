            He lives with his wife and their three grown-up children in a
            village called Trøllanes on the most northerly tip of the island.
            The village sits in a hollow, smoothly rounded by glacial ice. To
            get to the village you must drive through a narrow one-way tunnel
            with no lighting. Before it was built in the 1970s the village could
            only be accessed by boat.
